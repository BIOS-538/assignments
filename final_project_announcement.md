Here's the announcement with the format for the final projects!
----

Hello! Hope you had a restful spring break. It is time now to start planning for your **final projects**. 

## What's the project?
This is an opportunity for you to use all the R and plotting skills you learnt so far and some of the stats that we shall cover soon on any dataset of your choice to answer interesting questions. You will present your work in a final presentation to the class (6 m present + 3 min questions)    

## Timeline
- Take the next 1 week to meet with your groups and brainstorm ideas
- You will submit one paragraph to explain what questions you will answer and what dataset you have chosen for this ()
- You will have 2 weeks to work on your final projects : 1st Apr to 15th April
- Presentations will happen on the last week of classes. 16th - 19th April ; + 1/2 sessions outside of class hours
- Final reports are due on 26th April (*middle of exams period*)

## Proposal format
For the proposal, you can discusss with your team and chose either of these two options for datasets. It would be ideal to propose one main idea + 1/2 more half-baked/sub-ideas that you discussed _just in case one of them looks promising!
Note that the answer to your questions should **involve some data-wrangling, plotting, and statistical testing** (t-tests/correlation/regressions etc.)
- **Scientific data** / bringing your own data (self-generated / from other lab members / scientific data from any published paper of interest / journalistic data of scientific rigour/interest)
	- Propose **2 questions** to answer. _For example, you could extend or improve the statistics used in a paper.._
 	- If you are unsure of what scientific data means, just try your luck by proposing multiple ideas / drop all 3 of us an email/canvas message! (_it is subjective.._)
 - **Other data** sources (_more like hobby analysis/ sports data /data from Tidytuesday etc._)
 	- Propose **3 questions**! 
 - Do post on the [discussion board](https://edstem.org/us/courses/51883/discussion/) if you had extra ideas that you are willing to _lend_ to other teams! **+1 bonus point** if any team uses your extra ideas ðŸ˜„
 	- Do indicate on the post (credits : myself / team) depending on who generated the idea so we allocate the bonus accordingly! 	

You can come ask for **ideas/feedback during office hours** too!

## Groups vs individual?
If you want to work with your own data and your team isn't too keen on this, you can always do the project individually. Just make this clear to your group and submit the proposal individually from the group's proposal.
You can change groups or reorganize as you wish, all we need is that you make the group on [canvas](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/How-do-I-create-a-group-as-a-student/ta-p/280) when submitting the proposal and we will assume that's the group doing the final project together!

## Grading rubric
Here's how the projects shall be **graded**. Each point here corresponds to 1% of the final grade.
- 10 points for the **in-class presentation** (_use any format: google slides, ppt, use quarto only if you are adventurous!_)
	- Interesting question: 2 points
	- Good choice of methods: 2 points
	- Good visuals: 2 points
	- Clarity of presentation: 2 points
 	- Answering questions: 2 points 

- 10 points for **written report** (_in quarto: submit the rendered `.html` file which is what we will grade + also include the `.qmd`_)
	- Through with all necessary details: 2 points
	- visual clarity and layout of information: 2 points
	- Statistical support to arguments: 4 points
	- Detailed references/attributions: 2 points
- +2 bonus points for audience choice of best presentation! (_voting on Ed discussion!_)

Note that _the maximum points will be capped at 20 including bonuses_
The grade here will apply alike to all the team members. Please do indicate contributions at the end of the written report. In extreme cases if someone on the team hasn't contributed to a reasonable extent, you can email the instructor for redressal.

## Project/data ideas

**Project ideas / where to get datasets from**
- [Tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) challenges give data and let you explore. You can find good examples solutions
	- Glance of a few TidyTuesday [visualizations](https://github.com/jack-davison/TidyTuesday) over time
	- Ex: Building [simple models](https://juliasilge.com/blog/intro-tidymodels/) from NFL data
- Spotify : [data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-01-21); ideas - [podcast episode](https://www.tidytuesday.com/15); 
- List of [free datasets](https://blog.journeyofanalytics.com/50-free-datasets-for-data-science-projects/) for inspiration
	- kaggle.com [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
 - If you are a basketball/sports enthusiast, you can consult @Sam in office hours for any ideas ðŸ˜ƒ

Ideas from [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/r-project-ideas) : Apart from popular topics (such as [Exploring the NYC Airbnb Market](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/1354), [Visualizing COVID-19](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/870), [Clustering Heart Disease Patient Data](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/552), or [Predict Taxi Fares with Random Forests](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/496)) that are traditionally analyzed in various data science schools, here, you'll also find numerous fresh and curious ones. Feel free to explore them more in-depth: (_visit the datacamp link for hyperlinks and search for these datasets outside the datacamp website)_
